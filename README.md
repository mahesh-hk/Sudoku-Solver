# Sudoku Solver with Random Puzzle Generator

A C++ Sudoku solver that uses backtracking to solve puzzles that are randomly generated with a customizable number of empty cells.


## Features

- ðŸŽ² Random puzzle generator (with solvability checking)
- ðŸ–¨ Clean ASCII board output with 3x3 box formatting
- âœ” Verifies all placements for Sudoku rules



## How it Works

- A full valid board is first generated with random values
- Then a number of cells are blanked out randomly (default: 40)
- The backtracking solver attempts to fill the blanks
